      <h1 class="content__h1">Why you should learn to fly!</h1>
      <p class="content__p">
        Learning to fly a plane is a very rewarding experience that will change your life and open up so many new opportunities. Flying requires a lot of dedication and hard work, but you will look back and appreciate the steps you took to learn how to safely fly a plane. You will be able to travel around Canada and the United States so much faster, opening your world to possibilities that you would have never considered before.</p>
      <p class="content__p">
        Many pilots either choose to fly for fun or fly for career. Those who wish to start their journey into aviation can simply get started by obtaining a Recreational Pilot Permit or a Private Pilot License. However those who are interested in an aviation career would require additional training licenses such as a Commercial Pilot License or an Airline Transport Pilot License.
      </p>

      <h1 class="content__h1">What is a Private Pilot License?</h1>
      <p class="content__p">
        In Canada, a Private Pilot License is the most commonly held license earned by pilots. A PPL allows you to fly as PIC (pilot-in-command) or co-pilot of a single engine aeroplane during the day and under VFR (visual flight rules). However, through additional training, class ratings may be added to this license to obtain further privileges. These include a seaplane rating, multi-engine rating, night rating, and an instrument rating. Although you may not use this license for commercial purposes, you are allowed to reimburse fuel costs with your passengers. This license also allows you to carry as many passengers as your aircraft can legally carry and you can fly practically anywhere in the world as long as you comply with the foreign requirements. The most common type of aircraft used for training is the Cessna 172, a single engine, high wing, 4-seater aeroplane. It is designed to be easy to fly and is famous for its ability to survive many unfortunate landings.

      <p class="content__p">
      	There are very few prerequisites needed to get started with flying. You only need to be at least 17 years of age to acquire your license and at least 14 during your first solo flight. Also, an authorized Medical Examiner must certify that you are medically able to safely fly a plane by issuing a <a href="http://roccolombardi.ca/index.php/forms-resources/medical-certification-categories">Medical Certificate</a>.
      </p>

      <h1 class="content__h1">Requirements</h1>
      <ul class="content__p">
        <li>Complete a minimum of 40 hours private pilot aeroplane ground school instruction</li>
        <li style="padding-bottom: 0">Complete a minimum of 45 hours total flight time with:
          <ul>
            <li>Minimum 25 hours of dual flight training</li>
            <li>Minimum 20 hours of solo flight training</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Successfully complete a flight test to the standard outlined in the <a href="https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/publications/flight-test-guide-private-pilot-licence-aeroplane-tp-13723#guide">Flight Test Standards</a></li>
        <li>Obtain a minimum of 60% on the written examination for Private Pilot Licence â€“ Aeroplane (PPAER)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="content__p">
        In order to obtain your private pilot license, there are certain requirements such as ground school, minimum flight time, and examinations. Ground school is where you will learn everything you need to know to pass your written exam. Dual flight training is where your instructor will show you all aspects of aircraft handling, and, when you are ready, you can fly without an instructor on board for your solo training.
