      <p class="content__p">
        Before taking the flight exam for a Private Pilot License, students must show evidence of having completed at least 35 hours of total flight time. However, the length of the training will be dependent on each student. Although the minimum requirement for a Private Pilot License is 45 hours, the average amount of flight hours a student takes to obtain the license is anywhere between 65 – 85 hours. Each student will complete training for all exercises with a certified flight instructor and keep a log their training hours in their pilot logbook.
      </p>
      <p class="content__p">
